# Tailwind template

This is a template for serving static files with Tailwind's [JIT compiler](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) enabled.

## Setup

Install dependencies:
```
npm ci
```

Start the dev server:
```
npm run start
```
This will start a server on `http://localhost:8080`, with live reloading enabled for both the HTML and CSS.

## Recommended dev environment
It is recommend to use Visual Studio Code in combination with the [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin. See the Tailwind [documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-support) for more info on editor support.
